About this project:
Concept site for Sunset skim-boards.

This site has a home page, an about section with a brief history about the company, a gallery as well as a basic contact details display. There is also a link to the shop where users can view products and add them to the cart. When items are added to the cart they are stored in local storage. Items in the cart can have the quantities increased/decreased and can also be removed from the cart.
